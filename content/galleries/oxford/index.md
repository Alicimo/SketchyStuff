The end of April so us on a long road trip down to Oxford to meet up with Hazel's friends from university - not that she went to Oxford, you understand (she went to the University of London), but it was a central place to meet up. We decided to make a week of it, so here is the story, in pictures. It reminds me of what a lovely country we actually live in , with amazing buildings and monuments, and equally amazing volunteers who look after these (especially in the National Trust - I salute you and the work you do!)
